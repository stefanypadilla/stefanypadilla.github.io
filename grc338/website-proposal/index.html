        <h1> About </h1>
        <p> In September 2012, the three of us, all long time friends (Stefany and Nayeli since childhood, Lexi since high school), had become enamored with the concept of smoothies. We were constantly looking for healthy, low fat, high-energy meals. We found that smoothies offered us exactly what we were looking for and tasted great. We also realized that we were not the only ones who felt that a smoothie was a perfect meal alternative.</p>
        <h4> Where? When? How?</h4>
        <p> We decided on the San Luis Obispo area because it was a place we knew and loved, and where active healthy life-styles seemed to flourish. Our name was Nayeli’s inspired choice to convey our emphasis on healthy, blended drinks.</p>
        <h4> Our Vision </h4>
        <p> As part of our development, we traveled around California visiting nearly every operating juice bar. Some shops had poor quality smoothies, some had bad service, and some had both.  Our vision evolved and soon crystallized. We would consistently provide the highest quality product in a clean, fun atmosphere, and in a quick manner.</p>
        <p>For nearly 10 years now, Blended Bliss has curated famous flavors served by friendly staff. From smoothies, to smoothie bowls, to meals we got you covered! Fantastic flavor is always in season and nothing beats feeling your best. We look forward to sharing our fantastic flavors with you!</p>
        <h4>Our Local Commitment</h4>
        <p> Because we are part of a local community, we are committed to supporting local schools, athletic teams, and organizations through donations and sponsorships. </p>
